	<h3>Lyrics</h3>


	<span>Riders on the storm</span>
	<span>Riders on the storm</span>
	<span>Into this house we're born</span>
	<span>Into this world we're thrown</span>
	<span>Like a dog without a bone</span>
	<span>An actor out alone</span>
	<span>Riders on the storm</span>
	
	

	<div>There's a killer on the road<br>
His brain is squirmin' like a toad<br>
Take a long holiday<br>
Let your children play<br>
If ya give this man a ride<br>
Sweet memory will die<br>
Killer on the road, yeah<br></div>

<p>Girl ya gotta love your man<br>
Girl ya gotta love your man<br>
Take him by the hand<br>
Make him understand<br>
The world on you depends<br>
Our life will never end<br>
Gotta love your man, yeah<br></p>

	<p>Yeah!<br></p>

<p>Riders on the storm<br>
Riders on the storm<br>
Into this house we're born<br>
Into this world we're thrown<br>
Like a dog without a bone<br>
An actor out alone<br>
Riders on the storm</p>

<p>Riders on the storm<br>
Riders on the storm<br>
Riders on the storm<br>
Riders on the storm<br>
Riders on the storm</p>
